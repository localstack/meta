# LocalStack Meta Repository

This repo aims at unifying certain processes and tools across our repositories.

## sync-labels
This reusable workflow ensures that a set of labels are present in the repository.
The workflow can be used like this:
```yaml
name: Sync Labels

on:
  schedule:
  - cron: "0 0 * * *"
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  sync-with-project:
    uses: localstack/meta/.github/workflows/sync-labels.yml@main
    with:
        categories: status,aws,semver
    secrets:
      github-token: ${{ secrets.REPO_ACCESS_PAT }}
```

- You can define the set of categories of labels which should be synced.
  - By default the `labels-status` are synced.
  - These labels are necessary for the `add-to-project`` workflow (see below).

- Make sure to use a PAT which has write access to the project.
  - f.e. the `localstack-bot` PAT we use in most of the repos
  - Don't forget to add it as a collaborator with write permissions in your repo!

## add-to-project
This reusable workflow performs two actions:
- It adds every newly created issue to a specified project (by default it uses https://github.com/orgs/localstack/projects/17).
- It sets the column in the project depending on the `status: ...` label on the issue.
  - If no or multiple status labels are set, it moves it to the "triage needed" column!

The workflow can be used like this:
```yaml
name: Sync Project Cards

on:
  issues:
    types:
    - labeled
    - unlabeled
    - opened

jobs:
  sync-with-project:
    uses: localstack/meta/.github/workflows/add-to-project.yml@main
    secrets:
      github-token: ${{ secrets.REPO_ACCESS_PAT }}
```

## stale-bot
This reusable workflow defines the default usage of our stale bot in public repos of LocalStack.

The workflow can be used like this:
```yaml
name: Triage Stale Issues

on:
  schedule:
  - cron: "0 * * * *"
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  sync-with-project:
    uses: localstack/meta/.github/workflows/stale-bot.yml@main
    secrets:
      github-token: ${{ secrets.REPO_ACCESS_PAT }}
```

## pr-enforce-semver-labels
```yaml
name: Enforce SemVer Labels
on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [labeled, unlabeled, opened, edited, synchronize]

jobs:
  enforce-semver-labels:
    uses: localstack/meta/.github/workflows/pr-enforce-semver-labels.yml@main
    secrets:
      github-token: ${{ secrets.REPO_ACCESS_PAT }}
```

## pr-enforce-no-major
```yaml
name: Enforce no major on master

on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [labeled, unlabeled, opened, edited, synchronize]
    # only enforce for PRs targeting the master branch
    branches:
    - master

jobs:
  enforce-no-major:
    permissions:
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
    uses: localstack/meta/.github/workflows/pr-enforce-no-major.yml@main
    secrets:
      github-token: ${{ secrets.REPO_ACCESS_PAT }}
```

## pr-enforce-no-major-minor
```yaml
name: Enforce no major or minor on master

on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [labeled, unlabeled, opened, edited, synchronize]
    # only enforce for PRs targeting the master branch
    branches:
    - master

jobs:
  enforce-no-major-minor:
    permissions:
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
    uses: localstack/meta/.github/workflows/pr-enforce-no-major-minor.yml@main
    secrets:
      github-token: ${{ secrets.REPO_ACCESS_PAT }}
```
## upgrade-python-dependencies

This reusable workflow adds an automated upgrade of dependencies in python repositories.
As a prerequisite the repository must define the make target `upgrade-all-deps` which should produce some kind of lock file checked in into the repository.

```yaml
name: Upgrade pinned Python dependencies

on:
  workflow_call:
    secrets:
      github-token:
        required: true
        description: A GitHub token with access to the issues of the calling repo

jobs:
  upgrade-dependencies:
    name: Upgrade Pinned Python Dependencies
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python 3.11
        id: setup-python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.11"

      - name: Upgrade all requirements files
        run: make upgrade-all-reqs

      - name: Create PR
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
        with:
          title: "Upgrade pinned Python dependencies"
          body: "This PR upgrades all the pinned Python dependencies."
          branch: "upgrade-dependencies"
          author: "LocalStack Bot <localstack-bot@users.noreply.github.com>"
          committer: "LocalStack Bot <localstack-bot@users.noreply.github.com>"
          commit-message: "Upgrade pinned Python dependencies"
          labels: "area: dependencies, semver: patch"
          token: ${{ secrets.github-token }}
```
